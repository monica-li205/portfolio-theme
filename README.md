<!-- ## Installation
There are several ways to install UnderStrap. We'll look at three of them: (1) classic install by uploading UnderStrap to a WordPress install, (2) using npm, and (3) using the theme directory in WordPress.

### Classic install
- Download the understrap folder from GitHub or from [https://understrap.com](https://understrap.com)
- IMPORTANT: If you download it from GitHub make sure you rename the "understrap-master.zip" file just to "understrap.zip" or you might have problems using child themes!
- Upload it into your WordPress installation theme subfolder: `/wp-content/themes/`
- Login to your WordPress backend
- Go to Appearance → Themes
- Activate the UnderStrap theme

### npm install
- Open your terminal
- Change to the directory where you want to add UnderStrap
- Type `npm install understrap`

### WordPress.org install
- Open your WordPress backend
- Click on "Appearance -> Themes"
- Hit the "Add new" button
- Search for "UnderStrap"
- Hit the "install" button
- Activate the theme

## Developing With npm, Gulp and SASS and [Browser Sync][1]

### Installing Dependencies
- Make sure you have installed Node.js and Browser-Sync (optional) on your computer globally
- Then open your terminal and browse to the location of your UnderStrap copy
- Run: `$ npm install`

### Running
To work with and compile your Sass files on the fly start:

- `$ gulp watch`

Or, to run with Browser-Sync:

- First change the browser-sync options to reflect your environment in the file `/gulpconfig.json` in the beginning of the file:
```javascript
{
    "browserSyncOptions" : {
        "proxy": "localhost/theme_test/", // <----- CHANGE HERE
        "notify": false
    },
    ...
};
```
- then run: `$ gulp watch-bs`

## How to Use the Built-In Widget Slider

The front-page slider is widget driven. Simply add more than one widget to widget position “Hero”.
- Click on Appearance → Widgets.
- Add two, or more, widgets of any kind to widget area “Hero”.
- That’s it.

## RTL styles?
Add a new file to the themes root folder called rtl.css. Add all alignments to this file according to this description:

## Page Templates
UnderStrap includes several different page template files: (1) blank template, (2) empty template, and (3) full width template.

### Blank Template

The `blank.php` template is useful when working with various page builders and can be used as a starting blank canvas.

### Empty Template

The `empty.php` template displays a header and a footer only. A good starting point for landing pages.

### Full Width Template

The `fullwidthpage.php` template has full width layout without a sidebar.
